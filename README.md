##AutoPay Docs
This is a system that enables the automation of repetitive payments such as basic needs so as to ease the process of manual payment procedures. It  involves the development of a web application that allows users to set up their essential expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and more. Once these needs are defined, the application automates the payment process by sending notifications to the user, requesting their permission to settle the bills on their behalf.
